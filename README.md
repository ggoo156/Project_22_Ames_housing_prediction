# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

### Forward
The goal of this project is to predict the the Ames housing sale price by using regression models. Within this repository, you will find a documented process for sourcing, cleaning, modeling, and evaluating data. The models and methods contained here are intended for use by Zillow or other housing price websites for reference but we invite and encourage anybody to use this analysis to predict what there house sale price might be. (We will also submit our sale price for Kaggle competition!)
